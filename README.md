<img src="https://github.com/Cris4110/FogartyGeneratorServices/blob/main/public/Fogarty%20Generator%20Service%20Logo%20Design.png" width="400" />
Definition: Fogarty Onsite Generator Service Website is a portal that replaces the clients call and text business, giving the customers the opportunity to schedule appointments, request quotes, make purchase requests, and much more.<br><br>

Purpose: Fogarty Onsite Generator Service primarily runs through a text and call model which leads to many issues. Customers cannot reliably get help with their generator needs through these promotions, which leads to overbooked schedules and potentially missed clients. This is a solution that provides resources to customers and helps reduce reliance on this primary source of contact. By creating this website, customers can view his services, book appointments, read reviews, view available items, and strengthen his independent online presence.

## Current features 
Our platform includes a full set of features designed to give users an easy way to explore services, request quotes, manage their accounts, and purchase products. The system ensures a smooth experience even for visitors who are not logged in, while still offering more advanced options for registered users.

**General Access**
- FAQ Page – Users can browse frequently asked questions for quick help.
- Contact Page – Users can reach out directly for inquiries or support.
- Request a Free Quote (No Login Needed) – Visitors can submit a quote request even without creating an account.

**Profile & Account**
- User Registration – Create an account using a simple signup process.
- User Login – Secure login system to access personalized features.
- Profile Settings – Logged-in users can update personal details through the settings page.

**Profile & Account**
- Request Services (Logged-in Users) – Users can request maintenance, repair, or other services.
- Buy Generators & Parts On-Hand – A dedicated page to browse available generators and parts currently in stock.
- Track Requests (Optional) – Users can follow the status of their submitted service requests.

Alongside the user facing functionality, we provide a powerful admin dashboard that allows the business to manage inventory, monitor service requests, and maintain the platform efficiently. Both sides work together to support real time operations and ensure accuracy.

**Inventory Management**
- Add new parts or generators.
- Edit existing product details.
- Remove outdated or unavailable inventory.

**Service Request Management**
- Accept service requests.
- Hold requests for review or follow-up.
- Decline requests when needed.

**Platform Control**
- Keep track of user activity and incoming quote request.
- Manage system data and keep product availability up to date.

## Upcoming Features
During the timeline of late January 2026 to early April 2026, our team plans to implement the following features:

**Authentication**
- Currently, customers and admins can create an account and log in, but we do not yet have a full authentication system to verify their accounts. We plan to integrate Firebase Authentication as our authentication API to securely handle account verification and login.

**Notification**
- We plan to implement APIs to send email and SMS notifications for appointment requests and appointment reminders.

**Settings**
- For admins, we plan to provide the ability to modify website content to post updates. We also plan to add general settings for both admins and customers, including notification preferences.

**Reviews**
- We plan to create a review system that is used only within the website. Reviews will be triggered by completed appointments and will be visible to all users.

**Quotes**
- An account-free system for customers to submit quote requests describing their general needs. These requests will be reviewed by admins to provide a rough cost estimate.

**Wave Integration**
- An account-free system for customers to submit quote requests describing their general needs. These requests will be reviewed by admins to provide a rough cost estimate.

**Domain & Hosting**
- During development, the application is running on `localhost` for both the frontend and backend. Before the client begins using the platform in production, we will utilize a custom domain name.

## Security
Passwords are hashed and never stored in plaintext. Authentication is handled by our backend, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an additional security layer during login.

**Authentication and Authorization**
- Secure registration and login using server-side validation and hashed passwords 
- Multi-factor authorization (MFA) will also be implemented for logging in and account recovery (Future Development)
- Login tokens expire after 12 hours
- API keys are used for backend services
- .env files contain confidential information, so do not commit .env files or anything that compromises security

**Role-Based Access Control**
- There is a separate login page specifically for admins
- Only admins have access to change/manage appointments, inventory, and users
- Standard users can request appointments/quotes and purchase parts/generators
